## Skip Character Generation

If you're introducing complete newbies to the game, it's probably best 

The most basic thing to give your prospective players is a copy of the rules.
You don't have to go out and buy a ton of copies of the Player's Handbook to do
that, though.  You can print out copies of the free and official [Basic
Rules](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PlayerBasicRulesV03.pdf).
For new players, the basic rules are totally fine, and they're free, so it only
costs some paper and toner.

Clearly, a set of dice is needed for each player.  A single set of dice all the
same color per person is nice.  No one will fault you if you ask for them back
after the session.  Hopefully, everyone will have so much fun, they'll go out
and get their own for next time.
