Spell slinging wizard or sneaky rogue?  Shining paladin or ranger hunting her
prey?

Classes in D&D are a collection of related abilities that your character gains.
They're sort of like jobs, if choosing to be a plumber meant you suddenly
understood flow rates, welding, and some thermodynamics.  That is, they're jobs,
but choosing the job also gives you the abilities to do that job.

Each class has things it's good at, and things it's not good at.  There are no
"bad" classes.  They are all useful in your average D&D campaign.  

## One Liners

Here's the one line description of each, you'll find more detailed information below:

### Core Classes

These are the classes in the [Basic Rules](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PlayerBasicRulesV03.pdf), and are the core around which the rest
of the classes are built.  

\* indicates classes that are particularly suited to new players.

* Cleric - priest in armor with godly spells, can heal people
* *Fighter - hits stuff with sword or bow, has some nifty maneuvers
* *Rogue - sneaky thief, lightly armored
* Wizard - spellcaster with wide variety of spells, especially damaging spells, and no armor

### Extended Classes

These classes are only available in the Player's Handbook.

* *Barbarian - fighter who wears less armor and can dish out more damage.
* Bard - sings to cast spells, the "face" of the party
* Druid - nature and animal-loving spellcaster
* *Monk - unarmored martial artist
* Paladin - like a righteous, more fightery cleric with more armor and more melee focused
* Ranger - like a more fightery druid
* Sorcerer - like a wizard, but less variety of spells, but can manipulate them to cause different effects.
* Warlock - spellcaster devoted to an otherworldly power

Every class as different "subclasses" - these are minor variations to the
classes to give you ways to make your Wizard mechanically different from someone
else's Wizard, for example.  These are chosen at level 3, so we won't go into
them in depth here.

## In Depth

There's a few main things to consider when looking at classes 

1. What is the class' defining feature? 
1. What is their natural combat ability?
2. If they can cast spells, and the number and type of spells they get.
3. The kind of armor they can wear and how many hitpoints* they get.
4. How many skills they have access to.
5. What ability scores are useful for them.

(*hitpoints are a numerical number describing how much damage a character can
take before they die)

Basically all the classes can be compared by looking at these 5 different things.

## Core Classes

### Cleric

A cleric is a holy person, a priest or other practitioner of faith.  But a
cleric is more than that, they literally are given the ability to perform magic
by their faith in their god.

This is a cleric's defining feature - casting holy spells. They tend to get
protection and healing spells, though they have a limited number of offensive
spells.

Clerics can wear medium armor, and some sublasses can wear heavy armor. They
have moderate hitpoints.

Clerics generally do ok in melee... they don't have a ton of ways to increase
their damage, but their hitpoints and armor are decent enough. 

Clerics are not very skillful. They may know some history or religous stuff, but
they're not generally going to be scaling walls or picking locks.

Subclasses for clerics are called Domains, and represent different abiltiies for
worshippers of different domains.

Their spellcasting is based on Wisdom, so you should usually put your highest
score in Wisdom for a cleric.

### Fighter

A fighter's defing feature is... just that.  Combat.  Someone who is very good
with a bow or sword or axe.  Often they're the protypical soldier or street
brawler.  They generally don't throw spells, they're just really good at hitting
things.  

Fighters are skilled in fighting - they get a lot of abilities that let them do
things in battle that others can't.  They can use any armor, any weapon and have
the second largest hitpoints in the game.  They are extremely versatile in
combat.

Of course, some people want to fight and cast spells, and luckily there's a
subclass of fighter for that, called the Eldritch Knight.  They get a limited
number of spells, but enough that you feel like you have some pizzazz to go with
your sword swinging.

Fighters, like clerics, are not a skillful class.  They do best in a fight, and
usually aren't going to win debate club.

Generally strength and consitution are most important for a fighter, but you'd
want to prioritize dexterity over strength if you're using ranged weapons.

### Rogue

Rogues are the thieves, swashbucklers, and ne'er do wells of the D&D world.  If
there are shadows, chances are you'll find a rogue skulking in them.

Rogues' defining features are their breadth of skills (stealth, lock picking,
climbing, deception, etc).  They also have the ability to get extra proficient
at two skills (called Expertise), almost ensuring they'll be the best at those
skills. 

In combat, rogues are dangerous opponents that get to deal extra damage to
opponents they have advantage over (usually due to surprise), this is called
"Sneak Attack".  However, rogues generally don't wear a lot of armor, so they
are more fragile than fighters.

Rogues do not get spells, except for the Arcane Trickster subclasses which gets
a small amount.

Rogues nearly always want a high dexterity.  High intelligence or charisma can
be useful based on the type of skills your rogue wants to be good at.

### Wizard

A Wizard's defining feature is their spells.  They are spellcasters wielding
arcane magic they have learned through intense study.  They have the most varied
selection of spells in the game, including damaging spells like fireball and
more utility spells that help outside of combat.  The only type of spell they
truly lack is healing.

Wizards are not generally intended to fight with weapons. They only know simple
weapons and do not know how to use armor.  They have the fewest hitpoints in the
game, and therefore are always in danger if they get into combat.

Wizards have limited skill access as well, generally just book-knowledge, rather
than more practical skills.

Wizards can be some of the most powerful characters in the game, but must always
be wary due to their relative fragility in combat.

A wizard's spellcasting depends on intelligence, so that should be your highest
stat.

## Extended Classes

### Barbarian

A barbarian is a melee fighter from a less civilized area that uses his primal
rage to increase his combat abilities.  This rage is the class' defining feature
and the key to a lot of their abilities.

A Barbarian's rage gives them greater damage and resistance to weapon damage.
They have access to medium armor, but also are harder to hit than usual even
when unarmored (to allow for the barechested axe swinger trope).  They have the
most hitpoints in the game, and thus are great front line fighters.

Barbarians do not get spells, and may not cast spells while using their rage.
They are also not known for their skills, though they do have some facility with
outdoor skills.

Many of the barbarian's abilities are dependent on their constitution, and of
course their strength is the key to combat ability, so generally these two
abilities should be your highest stats.

### Bard

A bard is a charismatic sweet talker that dabbles in a little bit of everything,
especially magic and social skills.  

Bards have moderate hitpoints and access to light armor, making them less of a
front-line fighter, though they can do ok picking off stragglers. 

Bards get a very wide variety of spells, second only to a wizard, though with
fewer flashy damaging spells.

Bards can learn literally any skill, and gain access to expertise at later
levels to make them second only to rogues in their skills.

A bard's spellcasting and many of their skills are based on Charisma, so it
should be your highest stat, the next highest usually should be Dexterity, for
skills, defense, and offense.

### Druid

A druid is basically a nature-loving cleric with some very unique special
abilities.  Their defining feature is wildshape, which lets them turn into a
best such as a bear or tiger.

Druids are excellent spellscasters, getting a wide variety of magic, though it
tends toward more utilitarian and less healing that a traditional cleric.

Druids may wear medium armor and have a moderate hitpoints, so much like a
cleric, they're ok front line fighters, though with wildshape they can be
formidable.

Druids get some nature skills, but will not be on par with a ranger, bard or
rogue.

A druid's spellcasting is based on wisdom, so it should be your highest stat.

### Monk

Monks are fast moving unarmored martial artists, often using punches and kicks
instead of weapons.  Monks have mystical abilities beyond the powers of normal
people, but do not cast spells.

Monks are primarily melee combatants, despite their lack of armor.  They may
apply their wisdom modifier to AC, which helps keep them from being hit.  Their
hitpoints are moderate, so they should try to avoid the front line, but are very
effective mobile combatants.

Monks get no spells, but have some mystical spell-like abilities that give them
added interest over a straight sword-swinger.

Monks get limited skills, but can often keep up with the stealthy classes where
needed.

Most of a monk's abilities are based on Wisdom, and this should be their highest
stat, dexterity is by far the next most important stat and should also be high.

### Paladin

Paladins are holy warriors, similar to clerics, but more focused on melee combat
than spells.  

Paladins are primarily melee combatants, with access to heavy armor, good
hitpoints, and martial weapons.  Paladins have a good balance of offensive
abilities to attack enemies, and protective abilities to help their enemies.

Paladins have access to a limited spell list, mainly healing and protective with
a few damaging spells.

Paladins are not very skillful, and are usually the butt of clanking buckets of
armor jokes from the stealthier members of the party, though they can be very
effective in social situations due to their high Charisma.

Most of a paladin's abilities key off of Charisma, so that should be their
highest stat, followed by strength for combat.

### Ranger

Rangers are wilderness warriors - stealthy, deadly in combat, and skillful
navigators of the wild.  Their defining abilities are favored enemy and natural
explorer, which make them the best at exploring the wilderness.

Rangers are powerful combatants, either in melee or at range.  They get medium
armor and moderate hitpoints, as well as several abilities that increase their
damage.  

Rangers get a moderate amount of spells that are nearly all utilitarian in
nature, or at most help with their own combat damage.

Rangers get a good selection of skills, making them able to keep up with the
rogue in stealth, if not in social situations.

Rangers generally favor weapons that use Dexterity to hit, so that should likely
be your highest stat.

### Sorcerer

A sorcerer is an arcane spellcaster much like the Wizard, though one that casts
through an innate ability, rather than through study.  The sorcerer's defining
ability is metamagic - the ability to tweak spells as they are cast to fit the
current situation better.

Just like a wizard, a sorcerer is a poor physical combatant, getting the lowest
hitpoints in the game and no access to armor.

A sorcerer's spells are nearly the same as a Wizard's, focusing a bit more on
damaging spells and less on utility, though a sorcerer casts using Charisma
instead of intelligence.

Sorcerers have few skills, though their high Charisma will often make them
useful in social situations.

Since a sorcerer's spells are based on Charisma, it should be their highest stat.

### Warlock

A warlock is an unusual spellcaster that gains their spells from a pact with
otherworldly being.  They have unique abilities in addition to spells, called
Invocations, which can make them the most varied class in the game.

Warlocks get moderate hitpoints and light armor, making them not a front line
fighter, however they can gain abilities that increase their combat prowess that
can make them decent second line fighters.

Warlocks get spells, but cast unlike any other class. They get a very small
number of spells, but they regain them more quickly than other classes, and
their cantrips (spells they can cast repeatedly) are especially effective in
combat.

Warlocks get few skills, but their high charisma can help with certain social
situations.

A warlock's spells are cast using Charisma, so it should generally be their
highest stat, though Dexterity is a close second, perhaps even first for a
Warlock that specializes in combat.
