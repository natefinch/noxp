Here's a step by step guide (with page numbers!) to building a character in 5th
Edition D&D.  Note that this order is slightly different from the order in the
Player's Handbook and Basic Rules, because I think this order is more intuitive,
especially if you're new to the process.  Page numbers are given for the
[Player's
Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606)
(PHB) and [Basic Rules
pdf](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PlayerBasicRulesV03.pdf) (BR).

Ok, first things first, get you a [character
sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tl7U_nv8HNE1VGM9njOtZqejSqzN7yOs/view?usp=sharing).

Print it out, fill out Player Name (that's you).

## Step 0 - Figure out how ability scores are generated

Where you start will depend on how you are generating your ability scores (if
you're not sure, ask your DM first!).  The various methods of determining
ability scores are detailed near the beginning of the rules books (PHB 12, BR 7)
(or whatever your DM's custom method is).  

Because ability scores affect so much of your character, the exact character you
want to play may change depending on what stats you get.  If you are rolling
dice to generate your ability scores, skip to step 3 and generate them first,
then come back to step 1.  If you are using point buy or a standard array of
stats, go ahead and choose your race and class first, since you have full
control over your ability scores.

## Step 1 - Choose a class

Your class determines most of the abilities your character gets, so, you want to
choose this wisely.  This will be the define most of what your character
can do.  Now, keep in mind, your character is not just a bunch of skills and
abilities.  Your character's looks, personality, history, mannerisms, etc are
100% up to you, and the exact same character concept can be run with many
different classes.

Do you want to be a skillful sneak with a heart of gold?  You could be a rogue,
or a ranger, or a bard, or even a fighter.  The class does not define who your
character is, so much as what she's good at.  A rogue will be the best at
sneaking and getting the jump on someone in a dark alley.  A ranger will be best
at sneaking through the wilderness.  A bard will be the best at convincing the
guard that noticed you sneaking into the keep that you're actually wait staff.
And the fighter will be the best at going toe to toe with the guard when he
doesn't believe the bard.  Classe are at PHB 45-119 and BR 20-32.  

Note that there are several classes in the PHB that aren't in the Basic Rules.
That's ok.  The core classes are in the Basic rules and give you plenty of
variety to choose from.

Check out [Choosing a Class](https://noxp.io/players/choosing-a-class) for a
more detailed discussion on the classes and what they're good at.

Write down your class, you start at level 1, so write that down too.

## Step 2 - Choose Your Race

It may seem odd to choose something so foundation as what species your character
is *after* you've chosen what that character's job is, but that's because your
race really only affects about 10% of your in-game abilities.  Once you've
chosen a class, your race makes only a small difference.  A halfling wizard is
only going to be slightly less effective than a high elf wizard, and both will
still be fun to play.  There's very few downright *bad* class/race combos in the
game, so if something sounds cool, just go for it.  Races are discussed on PHB
17 and BR 11.

Write down your race on the sheet. 

## Step 3 - Generate ability scores

The various methods of determining ability scores are at (PHB 12, BR 7) (or
whatever your DM's custom method is). Follow the rules given by your DM / in the
handbook. 

For most methods of generating ability scores, after you generate the numbers,
you get to assign them to specific attributes of your choice.  For more detail
on that, see [Assigning Ability
Scores](https://noxp.io/players/assigning-ability-scores).

Assign the ability scores however you like, and apply racial bonuses.  These
bonuses simply modify the number you chose/rolled, so there's no need to keep
track of the original number.  Thus if you rolled a 14 dex and your race gives
you +2, you really only need to write down 16 for dex.  

Write the score in the small oval underneath the name of each stat on the left.
Yes, you have to write small, that's ok.  It turns out, the actual number for
your ability score doesn't really matter in the game.  What does matter is the
ability score modifier (a bonus or penalty), which is based on the stat.  Thus
we write the ability score small, and the modifier big.  So when someone asks
"What's your dex modifier?" It's easy to see and respond with the correct
number.

Here's how you find the modifier for each ability score, just write the modifer
in the big space right under the name of the ability score.

**Score**&nbsp;  |  &nbsp;**Modifier**
----- | :--------:
1	| −5
2–3	| −4
4–5	| −3
6–7	| −2
8–9 | −1
10–11 | +0
12–13 | +1
14–15 | +2
16–17 | +3
18–19 | +4
20–21 | +5
etc.
