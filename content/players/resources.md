Playing D&D is easy and fun.  Below are a bunch of links to online resources
where you can ask questions, read about D&D, and engage with the community.

But the very first thing you should do, is get a copy of the rules.  You could
go out and spend $30-$50 (USD) on the [Player's
Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606)
**or** you could get a free copy of the official [Basic
Rules](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PlayerBasicRulesV03.pdf) and
not pay a dime until you know you want to keep up with this thing.

## [ENWorld](http://www.enworld.org/forum/forum.php)

An old school D&D forum that has been around for forever. 

## Reddit's [D&D](https://reddit.com/r/dnd) and [D&D Next](https://reddit.com/r/dndnext)

These are the two main D&D subreddits.  Lots of traffic, lots of posts (sort by
new if you want to see more than the few most highly rated posts, which on D&D
are usually artwork).  Posting here is a great place to get a lot of eyeballs on
your stuff.  The D&D Next subreddit was originally created when 5th edition was
being playtested, and now just serves as a slightly more focused D&D subreddit
(for example, they don't allow posting artwork).
