Playing D&D is easy and fun.  Below are a bunch of links to online resources
where you can ask questions, read about D&D, and engage with the community.

## A Video Intro

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo_oR7YO-Bw) by Matt Colville is a
great introduction to playing D&D.  Matt is a long time veteran DM who also
happens to be great at explaining things. I'm not usually a video watcher, but
I've watched hours of Matt's videos, and I think you'll enjoy this one.

## [What Do You Actually *Do*?](https://noxp.io/players/your-first-game)
This is my introduction to the actual process of playing the game when you sit down at the table. Also useful for new DMs looking to understand how the game plays.


## Get The Rules

The very first thing you should do, is get a copy of the rules.  You could
go out and spend $30-$50 (USD) on the [Player's
Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606)
**or** you could get a free copy of the official [Basic
Rules](http://media.wizards.com/2016/downloads/DND/PlayerBasicRulesV03.pdf) and
not pay a dime until you know you want to keep up with this thing.

## The NoXP [Discussion Forum](https://reddit.com/r/NoXP)
The above link is to a discussion forum on reddit dedicated to discussing
beginner questions and questions about how to teach D&D, as well as any
suggestions people have for content on this site.


## [ENWorld](http://www.enworld.org/forum/forum.php)

An old school D&D forum that has been around for forever. 

## Reddit's [D&D](https://reddit.com/r/dnd) and [D&D Next](https://reddit.com/r/dndnext)

These are the two main D&D forums on reddit.  Lots of traffic, lots of posts
(sort by newest if you want to see more than the few most highly rated posts,
which on D&D are usually artwork).  Posting here is a great place to get a lot
of eyeballs on your stuff.  The D&D Next subreddit was originally created when
5th edition was being playtested, and now just serves as a slightly more focused
D&D subreddit (for example, they don't allow posting artwork).
