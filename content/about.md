Hi everyone, I'm Nate Finch, author of NoXP.io.  I've been playing Dungeons and
Dragons for 30 years, and want to share what I've learned with you.  I started
playing Basic D&D in 1988 and have played every edition of D&D that has come
out, as well as many other tabletop RPGs.  I have loved every edition of D&D,
but I think 5th edition (5e) is very special.  What I love best about 5e is how
critical its role has been in getting new players into the game.  The rules are
simple enough that they don't hinder newbies, but they're strong enough to keep
grognards like me happy.

I hope you find somethign interesting on this site.  If you do, drop me a
comment on twitter, respond to one of the posts, or hit me up on reddit.

Now, roll for initiative!
