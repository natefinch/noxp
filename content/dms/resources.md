## Matt Colville's [Running the Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-YZvLUXcR8&list=PLlUk42GiU2guNzWBzxn7hs8MaV7ELLCP_)

This is an epic youtube series from a guy who's been DMing for 30 years.  I
don't even normally *watch* youtube, because, seriously, who has the time?  But
I've watched hours of his stuff, and it's amazing.  This is aimed at getting
people who have never been a DM to run campaigns, but his insights are great
even for seasoned DMs. 

Beyond his running the game series, the campaign diaries have a lot of
insights, and almost everything he posts has some great nuggets of information. 

There's a companion subreddit
[r/mattcolville](https://reddit.com/r/mattcolville) which is a nice small
community of helpful people following Matt's videos.

## [The Angry GM](http://theangrygm.com/)

A really nice blog with a lot of great content.  His schtick is swearing and
rambling intros, but don't let that dissuade you, there's many gems in these
articles, and he's only pretending to be grumpy.

The best stuff is in his [How to GM](http://theangrygm.com/category/how-to-gm/)
series, but there's good stuff across the whole site.

## [The Tao of D&D](http://tao-dnd.blogspot.com/)

A blog by Alexis Smolensk, an unabashed grognard (i.e. super old school and
grumpy about it).  He's been a DM for 30 years and still plays a heavily
modified first edition ruleset.  He can be gruff and grumpy (and unlike the
Angry GM, I don't think he's faking), but he has a ton of really good insights
into how to be a good DM.  His [10,000 word
post](http://tao-dnd.blogspot.ca/2011/12/how-to-dungeon-master-10000-word-post.html)
on how to DM is epic.  

If you like to read, he loves to write hugely long posts, so head on over.  Just
ignore the grumpiness :)

## Reddit's [DM Academy](https://reddit.com/r/dmacademy)

This subreddit is dedicated to DMs helping DMs.  It's a great community and
everyone is super friendly. Even if you're not normally a reddit person, check
it out, there's tons to learn, and you don't even need to have an account if you
just want to read.

## Reddit's [D&D Behind The Screen](https://reddit.com/r/dndbehindthescreen)

This is an unusual subreddit in that it's not really for questions or
discussion, just for posting resources for DMs.  More aimed at intermediate DMs,
there's still tons of useful information for newbies.
