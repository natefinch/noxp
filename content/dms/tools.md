I've added a tool I built that didn't seem to exist anywhere else... a random magic items selector.  This one, unlike many on the internet, has every official magic item that exists on D&D Beyond.  None of the info exists on this website except a list of links.  The tool just chooses random links based on rarity.  It's very simple and dumb, and I'm ok with that.

Check it out [here](https://noxp.io/tools/magic-items).
